# PBCN
Privacy-Preserving Approach PBCN in Social Network With Differential Privacy:
For a given Graphical Dataset, We Create a new dataset following a certain Algorithm  and then compare Differential Privacy and Privacy protection level(P)
Output
P value(The protection level)
Then plot for the running time vs No.of edges
Protection level vs privacy budget
Installation Guide
pip! install random

pip! install networkx

pip! install copy
Note
For User-Desired input,

original_graph = generate_random_graph(num_edges)

What i am doing above is creating my own data.Since the code mentioned in Research paper is too huge to work on my device.But lets say you want Graph_user_Input to be used just do

original_graph = Graph_user_Input
Dependencies:
numpy
matplot
networkx
Copy
Random
